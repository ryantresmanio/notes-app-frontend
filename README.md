# 📝 Notes App

A simple fullstack **Notes App** built with **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. This project was created for practice and learning, and it's my first fullstack app developed entirely by myself. The backend is deployed on **Render**, and the frontend is hosted on **Vercel**.
